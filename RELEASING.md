## Introduction

Release process uses GitHub actions and involves:
- Creating a release branch to perform the following actions:
  - Dry run a maven release
  - Remove the "-SNAPSHOT" suffix from the version and create scm tag
  - Create a GitHub release and upload artifacts
- If patch release, delete the patch branch
- For a formal release only, increment snapshot version on a branch and open a pull request
- Publish the artifacts to GitHub Maven Repo

The release process used for this repository creates a branch for every release that is prefixed with `release/`. Tags are not added nor are releases performed on the `main` branch.
The `main` branch is the target for merging new commits and for development releases (-SNAPSHOT) only. All patches will originate using a `patch/` prefixed branch and once complete 
a new `release/` branch will be created.

## Versioning

While not strictly enforced, versioning generally follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) Guide.

## Release Types

### Formal Release

Formal release for the project and is intended to be stable.

```
Action: `Maven: Release`
Options:
- From: `Branch: main`
- Type: `Release`
- Suffix: Leave blank
```
Creates a branch called `release/<version>` and performs release. One commit is added to a branch called `action/<version>` only to increment to the next snapshot version, and
a pull request is created that needs to be approved and merged to finish the release process.


### Patch Release

Releases may have bugs or vulnerabilities with a high enough severity that requires a patch release to fix. Patch releases can only be performed from a patch branch (described below).

#### Create Patch Branch

Creating a patch branch can be done manually or using the GitHub action. The action was added as a convenience, and is not required as part
of the workflow.

Note: When manually creating a patch branch, the name must start with `patch/` and must be based on a release branch, i.e. `release/<version>`.
```
Action: `Create a Patch Branch`
Options:
- From: `Branch: release/<version>`
- Cherry pick: Optionally add commit hashes to cherry pick to the patch branch
```
Convenience action to simply create a branch called `patch/<version>`. The action must be run from a release branch, i.e. `release/<version>`.
The user can specify one or more commit hashes, separated by spaces, to cherry-pick to the newly created patch branch, i.e. `commitA commitB`.

#### Release Patch

Patch release for the project that intended to fix one or more bugs/vulnerabilities for a release.  Patches are not intended for new functionality
unless it is directly supporting a bugfix/hotfix.

```
Action: `Maven: Release`
Options:
- From: `Branch: patch/<version>`
- Type: `Patch`
- Suffix: Leave blank
```
Releases patch fixes from a branch called `patch/<version>`, i.e. `patch/8.0.x`. A release branch called `release/<version>` is created
and the release is performed. When finished, the patch branch is deleted. No commits or pull request are created to increment to the next version.

### Iterative Release (Milestone)

Like snapshots, iterative releases are not guaranteed to be stable, but allow for markers in the development stage and allow for testing and
feedback before a formal release. Currently, we support milestone releasing but the functionality can easily be extended to create other iterative
release types, e.g. alpha, beta, release candidates.

```
Action: `Maven: Release`
Options:
- From: `Branch: master`
- Type: `Milestone`
- Suffix: `-M1` <- this is just an example it can be anything, e.g. `M1` OR `-MILESTONE1`
```

Creates a branch called `release/<version><suffix>`, i.e. `release/8.0.0-M1`, and performs release. No commits or pull request are created to increment
to the next version.

## Publishing a Release

Publishing a release makes the artifacts available to other projects/teams. Artifacts are pushed to
[GitHub maven repository](https://github.com/orgs/NationalSecurityAgency/packages?repo_name=emissary).
```
Action: `Maven: Publish Packages to GitHub`
Options to use:
- From: `Branch: release/<version>`
```
Pushes release artifacts to a repo using `maven deploy`.

## Publishing a Release to Maven Central

Policy does not allow publishing to maven central via Action and is only authorized to be perforemd by specific individuals.

Using the `oss` profile will make the artifacts available here: [Sonatype/Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/gov.nsa.emissary/emissary)

In order for the following profile to work authorization is needed to publish to the gov.nsa.emissary maven group as well as having GPG signing configured in maven settings.
```
mvn clean deploy -Poss
```
